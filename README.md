**Chole EDA Tool: End-to-End CLI Based Tool for Daily Data Scientists**

---

## Overview:

Chole EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Tool is a command-line interface (CLI) based utility designed to streamline the process of exploratory data analysis for daily data scientists. This tool aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to analyze datasets, gain insights, and prepare data for further analysis or modeling tasks.

## Features:

1. **Data Loading**: Easily load various types of data formats including CSV, Excel, JSON, and more into the tool for analysis.

2. **Summary Statistics**: Quickly generate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical data.

3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize data distribution, correlation matrices, and trends using interactive plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

4. **Missing Values Handling**: Identify missing values in the dataset and apply various strategies for handling them, including imputation or removal.

5. **Outlier Detection**: Detect outliers in the data using statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.

6. **Feature Engineering**: Perform basic feature engineering tasks such as scaling, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features based on existing ones.

7. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Explore techniques for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).

8. **Export Results**: Export analysis results, summary statistics, and visualizations to commonly used formats such as CSV, Excel, or image files.
